# AdventOfCode_2020
My implementation of puzzles from Advent of Code 2020.

Main purpose of this project is to challenge myself with various programming tasks and evolve in Python skills and knowledge. 

Furthermore, this event and its Christmas atmosphere is a great opportunity to have fun while programming.
